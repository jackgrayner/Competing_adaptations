Sequencing and phenotypic data are available from PRJNA1019311 (NCBI SRA) and [UMD DRUM](https://doi.org/10.13016/ehst-57yz), respectively

### Crosses
R code and data used to test inheritance of the Cw phenotype and factors influencing its expression

### Life history
R code used to test effects of Cw and Fw on survival and traits of mass and SMI across adult ages

### Mate pref
R code and data used to test differences in female mate acceptance between Cw, Fw and singing-capable males

### RAD 
Shell and R code used to align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2 ([Zhang et al. 2024, Nat. Comm.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49344-4)); run SNP calling in Stacks; filter/process the VCF; and perform association tests for the CW phenotype

### RNA
Shell and R code used to align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2; produce transcriptome assemblies and estimate expression values in Stringtie, and analyse gene counts in DEseq2

### SLiM
Code used for simulations in [SLiM](https://messerlab.org/slim/) to investigate whether or under what conditions the co-occurrence of similarly adaptive mutations might impede their spread

### WGRS 
Shell code used to align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2 ([Zhang et al. 2024, Nat. Comm.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49344-4)); process BAM files and identify/call SNPs in bcftools, followed by filtering; and perform association tests for Cw and Fw phenotypes.
