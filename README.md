**Crosses:** 
R code and data used to test inheritance of the Cw phenotype.

**Life history:** 
R code used to test effects of Cw and Fw on survival and traits of mass and SMI across adult ages

**Mate pref:** 
R code and data used to test differences in female mate acceptance between Cw, Fw and singing-capable males

**RAD:** 
Shell and R code used to demultiplex and align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2 (Zhang et al. 2024, Nat. Comm.); run SNP calling in Stacks; filter/process the VCF; and perform association tests for the CW phenotype

**RNA:** 
Shell and R code used to align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2; produce transcriptome assemblies and estimate expression values in Stringtie, and analyse gene counts in DEseq2

**SLIM:** 
Slim code used to investigate whether or under what conditions the co-occurrence of similarly adaptive mutations might impede their spread

**WGRS:** 
Shell code used to align fastq.gz files to the T. oceanicus genome v2 (Zhang et al. 2024, Nat. Comm.); process BAM files and call SNPs in bcftools, followed by filtering; and perform association tests for Cw and Fw phenotypes.
